# Udemy - The Complete Blender Course 

This repo is for my coursework. I highly recommend taking the [course](https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/learn/v4/overview)

I am taking the course to improve my product design skills. I believe that [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org/) + [Blender](https://www.blender.org) will be the future of open source product design
